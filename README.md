# MNIST-deep-learning
Lab1 -contains the code for building a simple regression model using gradient decent on MNIST data set from scratch, I used only numpy library
for every calculation and training.
It also contains code for comparing the performance with Pytorch implementation.

Lab2- Comparing linear model and neural network with sogmoid activation on MNIST dataset.

Lab3- Comparing Mixup augmentation, standard augmentation and cutout augmentation on MNIST dataset.

Lab4- Adding noise to dataset and comparing the dropout vs regular model performance.
